# Cloudflare API Token Fix - Production Deployment Issue

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED DOCUMENT - Historical Reference Only**  
> **Status**: This document is no longer relevant - Aclue project has migrated to Vercel  
> **Migration Date**: August 6, 2025  
> **Current Hosting**: Vercel (no API token required for standard GitHub integration)

## Issue Identified ✅

**Root Cause**: The current Cloudflare API token is valid but lacks the necessary permissions to access the account and deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

**Error**: `Error code 9109: "Unauthorized to access requested resource"`

## Diagnostic Results

From our enhanced validation:
- ✅ API token is valid (token status: active)
- ❌ Cannot access account (missing Account:Read permission)
- ❌ Cannot access Pages project "aclue" (missing Cloudflare Pages:Edit permission)

## Fix Required

### Step 1: Generate New Cloudflare API Token

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Use "Custom token" template
4. Configure the token with these **exact permissions**:

```
Permissions:
├── Account:Read
├── Zone:Zone:Read
└── Cloudflare Pages:Edit

Account Resources:
├── Include: All accounts

Zone Resources:
├── Include: All zones (or specifically aclue.app if preferred)
```

### Step 2: Update GitHub Secrets

1. Go to https://github.com/griffin1995/gift_sync/settings/secrets/actions
2. Update `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with the new token
3. Verify `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is correct

### Step 3: Test the Fix

Run the deployment pipeline:
```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml --field environment=production --field skip_tests=false
```

## Expected Results After Fix

The enhanced validation should show:
- ✅ API token is valid
- ✅ Account access is valid
- ✅ Pages project 'aclue' is accessible
- ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (success)

## Technical Details

The current token validation endpoint (`/user/tokens/verify`) only checks if the token exists and is active, but doesn't validate the specific permissions needed for account access and Pages deployment.

Our diagnostic enhancement now properly validates:
1. Token validity
2. Account access permissions
3. Pages project access permissions

This ensures the token will work for the actual deployment before attempting it.

## Status

- **Issue**: IDENTIFIED ✅
- **Fix**: DOCUMENTED ✅
- **Implementation**: PENDING (requires token regeneration)
- **Verification**: PENDING (after token update)

The deployment pipeline is otherwise fully functional:
- ✅ Backend tests pass
- ✅ Frontend tests pass  
- ✅ Backend deployment works
- ✅ Security scans pass (with warnings)
- ❌ Frontend deployment blocked by token permissions
- ❌ Health checks fail (due to missing frontend)

Once the token is updated with correct permissions, the deployment should complete successfully.
