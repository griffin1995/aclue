aclue API - Main Application Entry Point
Pipeline Test: 2025-08-05 14:30 UTC

This module serves as the primary entry point for the aclue API application.
It configures the FastAPI application with all necessary middleware, routing,
logging, and lifecycle management for a production-ready gift recommendation platform.

Key Features:
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Production-ready middleware stack (CORS, security headers, rate limiting)
- Database connection management with connection pooling
- Health check endpoints for monitoring and orchestration
- Environment-specific configuration (dev/staging/production)
- Graceful startup and shutdown handling

Architecture:
- FastAPI as the ASGI web framework
- Supabase as the primary database (PostgreSQL)
- Redis for caching and session management
- Structured logging for observability
- Rate limiting and security middleware

Dependencies:
- FastAPI: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- Structlog: Structured logging with JSON output
- Uvicorn: ASGI server for production deployment
- Supabase: Backend-as-a-service with PostgreSQL

    Application lifespan context manager for startup and shutdown events.
    
    This function handles the complete lifecycle of the FastAPI application,
    including resource initialization, health checks, and graceful cleanup.
    
    Startup Process:
    1. Initialize database connections and verify connectivity
    2. Load and initialize ML recommendation models
    3. Establish Redis connection for caching
    4. Verify external service dependencies (Supabase, external APIs)
    5. Load configuration and feature flags
    
    Shutdown Process:
    1. Gracefully close all database connections
    2. Clean up ML model resources and memory
    3. Close Redis connections
    4. Flush any pending logs or analytics

        Currently using Supabase which handles database lifecycle automatically,

        prepared for future implementation.
