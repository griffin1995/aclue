# Aclue Development Session State Preservation
## Complete Context Capture for Session Resumption

### Document Metadata
- **Session Date**: 22 September 2025
- **Session ID**: aclue-migration-planning-092225
- **Current Time**: 16:45 GMT
- **Session Duration**: ~4 hours
- **Primary Focus**: Pages Router to App Router Migration Planning
- **Session State**: Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

---

## 1. SESSION RESUME INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Start Commands
To resume this exact session state:

```bash
# Step 1: Read CLAUDE.md to establish base context
"read claude.md"

# Step 2: Read this session state document
"read /home/jack/Documents/aclue-preprod/SESSION_STATE_PRESERVATION_2025-09-22.md"

# Step 3: Restore todo list (copy exact todos from section 3)
# Use TodoWrite tool with exact todos and statuses

# Step 4: Continue with Phase 1 implementation
"Begin Phase 1 Foundation setup for App Router migration following the 10-week plan"
```

### Critical Context to Restore
1. **Architecture Decision**: Pages Router → App Router migration required
2. **Current Phase**: Phase 2 classification COMPLETED, Phase 1 ready to begin
3. **Timeline**: 10-week migration plan created
4. **Performance Goal**: 0% → 70% server components transformation
5. **Production Status**: All systems operational, no code changes yet

---

## 2. COMPLETE PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Platform Overview
- **Platform**: Aclue - AI-powered gifting platform
- **Version**: 2.1.0 (Production)
- **Architecture**: Next.js 14 with Pages Router (current), migrating to App Router
- **Stack**: Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase + Vercel + Railway
- **Status**: Production operational at aclue.app

### Critical Discovery - Architecture Mismatch
**CRITICAL FINDING**: Documentation states "Next.js 14 (App Router)" but codebase analysis reveals:
- **Actual**: 100% Pages Router implementation
- **No `/app` directory**: Confirmed absence
- **All routing**: Through `/pages` directory
- **Components**: 100% client-side currently
- **Migration Required**: Full architectural transformation needed

### Security Findings
- **Authentication Risk**: Client-side JWT handling identified
- **Data Exposure**: User metadata visible in client bundles
- **Priority**: Security improvements through server-side migration

```

### Completed Actions
1. ✅ Context manager activation and project leadership establishment
2. ✅ Search specialist recovery (skipped non-critical security tasks)
3. ✅ Architect analysis of current codebase structure
4. ✅ Component classification document creation
5. ✅ 10-week migration plan development

## 4. NEXT ACTION PLAN

### Immediate Priority: Phase 1 Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

#### Week 1 Tasks - Environment Preparation
```bash
# Day 1-2: Branch Strategy
- Create feature/app-router-migration branch
- Setup app directory structure
- Configure parallel Pages/App Router support

# Day 3-4: Feature Flags
- Implement feature flag system
- Create environment variable controls
- Setup gradual rollout mechanism

# Day 5-7: Build Configuration
- Update next.config.js
- Configure server component optimisation
- Setup monitoring infrastructure
```

#### Week 2 Tasks - Server Component Foundation
```bash
# Day 1-3: Component Library
- Create /src/components/server/ directory
- Implement base server components
- Establish data fetching patterns

# Day 4-5: Auth Server Components
- Migrate auth context to Server Components
- Create auth layout structure
- Implement server-side validation

# Day 6-7: Testing Setup
- Configure Cypress for App Router
- Setup Jest for server components
- Create performance baselines
```

### Optimal Agent Workflow
1. **frontend-developer**: Execute Phase 1 implementation
2. **architect-reviewer**: Validate foundation architecture
3. **testing-specialist**: Setup comprehensive testing
4. **performance-optimizer**: Establish baseline metrics
5. **security-specialist**: Verify auth migration security

---

## 5. DECISION HISTORY & RATIONALE

### Key Decisions Made

#### Decision 1: Skip Security Deep Dive
**Context**: Security specialist suggested comprehensive audit
**Decision**: Postpone until after migration planning
**Rationale**: Architecture clarity needed before security improvements

#### Decision 2: 10-Week Migration Timeline
**Context**: Major architectural transformation required
**Decision**: Phased 10-week approach with zero downtime
**Rationale**: Production stability while achieving 70% server components

#### Decision 3: Tier-Based Migration Strategy
**Context**: 100% client components need transformation
**Decision**: Three-tier approach (85%, 75%, 50% server)
**Rationale**: Prioritise security-critical components first

#### Decision 4: Feature Flag Implementation
**Context**: Production system needs continuous operation
**Decision**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
**Rationale**: Risk mitigation and rollback capability
