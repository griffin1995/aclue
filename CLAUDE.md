# Claude Development Context - GiftSync Project

## Project Overview
GiftSync is an AI-powered gift recommendation platform that uses swipe-based preference discovery to generate personalized gift suggestions while maintaining the element of surprise. The platform targets a Â£45B global gift market with projected Â£2.5M revenue by Year 3.

## Business Context
- **Target Market**: Â£45B global gift market, Â£9.3B UK market
- **Revenue Model**: 7.5% average affiliate commissions + premium subscriptions
- **User Targets**: 1M+ users by Year 3, 25%+ conversion rate improvement
- **Key Segments**: Digital natives (18-35), busy professionals (25-45), corporate gifting

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Technology Stack (Finalized)
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (chosen over Google Cloud for better ML services and affiliate integrations)
- **Mobile**: Flutter 3.16+ (superior swipe gesture performance, single codebase)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python (seamless ML integration, high performance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + DynamoDB (sessions) + Redis (caching)
- **ML Pipeline**: PyTorch + SageMaker for hybrid recommendation system
- **Infrastructure**: EKS + Lambda + Terraform IaC

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Swipe Sessions**: Immediate storage with async batch processing every 5 minutes
2. **Recommendations**: Pre-compute nightly, real-time updates after 10+ swipes
3. **Affiliate Strategy**: Direct integration (Amazon API) + aggregators (Commission Junction)
4. **GDPR Compliance**: Pseudonymized user IDs, 90-day raw data retention, explicit consent
5. **Data Privacy**: Privacy-first design with performance optimization
