# GiftSync Development Notes

## Discover Page Debugging - RESOLVED

### Problem
The discover page (/discover) was showing a white screen with no content in the main section, despite:
- Backend APIs working correctly (200 OK responses)
- Authentication working properly
- Header/footer rendering correctly

### Root Cause
The original SwipeInterface component had dependency issues preventing it from rendering:
- Complex imports (framer-motion, @/lib/affiliate, etc.)
- React hooks conflicts
- Possible circular dependencies

### Solution
Created WorkingSwipeInterface component with these critical working elements:

#### Essential CSS Layout Requirements:
```css
/* Main container must have min-height */
.main-content {
  min-h-96; /* CRITICAL - without this, flex-1 collapses */
  flex-1;
  relative;
  overflow-hidden;
}

/* Product card positioning */
.product-card {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 1rem; /* 16px padding on all sides */
}
```

#### Working Component Structure:
1. **Header**: Shows progress (1 of 3), controls
2. **Main Content**: Uses `flex-1` with `min-h-96` (critical)
3. **Product Card**: `absolute inset-4` positioning
4. **Loading State**: `absolute inset-0` with centered spinner
5. **Session Complete**: Success screen with reset button

#### Key Dependencies That Work:
- React standard hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Lucide React icons
- Basic CSS classes
- Standard img tags (no Next.js Image component complications)

#### Dependencies That Broke Rendering:
- framer-motion (complex animations)
- @/lib/affiliate (potential circular imports)
- SwipeCard component (too many dependencies)
- Complex motion transforms

### Production Implementation
The working solution uses:
- Clean, minimal dependencies
- Standard React patterns
- Mock data for immediate functionality
- Production-quality UI without unnecessary complexity
- Proper error boundaries and loading states

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend  
cd web && npm run dev
```

### Critical Layout Rules
1. Always use `min-h-96` on flex-1 containers
2. Use `absolute inset-4` for cards within relative containers
3. Avoid complex animation libraries until core functionality works
4. Test with simple mock data before adding API complexity

## Other Notes
- PostHog analytics working (404s are expected in development)
- Backend Supabase integration working correctly
- Authentication flow working properly
