# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - READ FIRST

## ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE THESE - APPLIES TO ALL CONTEXT WINDOWS
1. **MANDATORY CODE DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION** - ALL CODE, EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF CODE, MUST ALWAYS BE CHECKED AGAINST LOCAL DOCUMENTATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. NEVER CREATE CODE WITHOUT VERIFYING IT FOLLOWS DOCUMENTATION BEST PRACTICES. THIS RULE APPLIES TO EVERY SINGLE LINE OF CODE WRITTEN.
2. **NEVER add attribution to any AI tools** in code comments, commit messages, or documentation
3. **NEVER mention AI assistance** in any form throughout the codebase
4. **ALWAYS use British English** spelling and terminology throughout all code, documentation, and user-facing content
5. **NEVER take shortcuts or create minimal versions** - Always implement the most optimal, production-ready, industry-standard solutions
6. **MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT** - If documentation for any language/framework/library is not available in docs/ directory, IMMEDIATELY STOP and explicitly ask the user to provide the relevant documentation before proceeding with any code implementation

## Core Development Principles
7. **REMEMBER the complete tech stack** even if parts aren't implemented yet - we follow a proper roadmap and architecture
8. **ALWAYS commit logical changes** at important steps with industry-standard commit messages following conventional commit format
9. **ALWAYS implement comprehensive, production-ready solutions** that meet enterprise standards for security, performance, and maintainability

## File Management Rules
10. **Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less**
11. **NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal**
12. **ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one**
13. **NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User**

## Documentation Strategy
14. **ALWAYS use documentation from the local docs/ directory** - all required documentation is provided locally
15. **NEVER fetch external documentation** - all necessary references are maintained in the docs/ directory
16. **MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION CHECK** - Before writing ANY code, ALWAYS verify the implementation against the relevant documentation in docs/ directory
17. **STOP AND ASK POLICY** - If documentation for any technology is missing from docs/ directory, IMMEDIATELY STOP all code implementation and explicitly request the user to provide the documentation
18. **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR UNDOCUMENTED CODE** - Never write code based on assumptions or general knowledge - ALL code must be verified against official documentation patterns
