# Automated Testing Arsenal for Modern Web Stacks

Your Next.js 14 + FastAPI + Supabase stack can leverage a powerful suite of automated testing tools that scan comprehensively without requiring manual test writing. Here's the complete toolkit across all 10 categories, with everything you need to implement automated quality assurance.

## Security fortress without writing tests

The security landscape for your stack demands multi-layered protection, and **Nuclei** emerges as the standout choice with 20.5K GitHub stars and 9,000+ vulnerability templates. This template-based scanner automatically discovers and tests for CVEs, misconfigurations, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities across your entire application.

```bash
# Install Nuclei
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest

# Scan your application automatically
nuclei -u https://your-app.com -severity critical,high -j -o results.json
```

**OWASP ZAP** provides comprehensive penetration testing through its Docker-based automation, crawling your application to find XSS, SQL injection, and authentication weaknesses. The baseline scan runs perfectly in CI/CD:

```bash
docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t zaproxy/zap-stable \
  zap-baseline.py -t https://your-app.com -J report.json
```

For source code security, **Semgrep** offers framework-aware scanning that understands both Next.js and FastAPI patterns, detecting hardcoded secrets, injection vulnerabilities, and business logic flaws in under 10 seconds for most codebases.

## Container and infrastructure scanning excellence

**Trivy** dominates the container security space with 23K stars, scanning Docker images, filesystems, and Git repositories for vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations. Its comprehensive approach covers OS packages, language dependencies, and generates SBOMs automatically:

```bash
# Install Trivy
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# Scan everything
trivy image --format json --output results.json your-image:tag
trivy fs . --security-checks vuln,config,secret
```

**Hadolint** ensures Dockerfile best practices while **Dockle** validates CIS Docker Benchmark compliance, catching issues like root user usage, missing health checks, and exposed secrets before deployment.

## Frontend accessibility and SEO automation

**Pa11y** leads accessibility testing with 6.1K stars, automatically scanning for WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 violations without any test writing. Its sitemap crawling capability makes full-site auditing effortless:

```bash
npm install -g pa11y-ci
pa11y-ci --sitemap https://your-site.com/sitemap.xml
```

For comprehensive frontend auditing, **Unlighthouse** revolutionizes the process by crawling your entire Next.js application with Google Lighthouse, discovering pages automatically and running parallel audits across your site:

```bash
npx unlighthouse --site https://your-site.com --build-static
```

## API testing that thinks for itself

**Schemathesis** transforms API testing by generating thousands of test cases from your FastAPI's OpenAPI specification, finding edge cases and server crashes without writing a single test:

```bash
pip install schemathesis
schemathesis run http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json --max-examples 500
```

The tool excels at finding 500 errors, schema violations, and integration failures that traditional testing misses. **Dredd** complements this by validating that your API implementation matches its documentation exactly, catching contract violations automatically.

## Performance monitoring without manual setup

**Lighthouse CI** provides automated Core Web Vitals monitoring with regression detection, integrating seamlessly with Next.js builds:

```bash
npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.15.x
lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage
```

The tool tracks LCP, FID, and CLS metrics across commits, alerting you to performance regressions before they reach production. For production monitoring, the **web-vitals** library integrates directly with Next.js's built-in analytics hooks.

## Code quality analysis on autopilot

**Ruff** has revolutionized Python linting with 30K+ stars, running 10-100x faster than alternatives while implementing 800+ rules from Flake8, Black, isort, and pylint combined:

```bash
pip install ruff
ruff check . --fix        # Lint and auto-fix
ruff format .            # Format code
```

For TypeScript, **ESLint with @typescript-eslint** remains the gold standard, built directly into Next.js with framework-specific rules for image optimization and routing patterns.

**CodeQL** provides semantic code analysis that understands data flow, automatically finding security vulnerabilities through GitHub's code scanning feature - completely free for public repositories.

## Database and dependency fortress

For PostgreSQL security, **PGDSAT** performs 70+ security checks against CIS benchmarks, validating authentication, SSL configuration, and privilege settings:

```bash
pgdsat -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -o report.html
```

Dependency scanning requires a multi-tool approach. **npm audit** provides built-in scanning for Node packages, while **pip-audit** handles Python dependencies with auto-fix capabilities:

```bash
npm audit --fix
pip-audit -r requirements.txt --fix
```

**Snyk CLI** unifies dependency scanning across languages with the industry's largest vulnerability database, offering 200 free scans monthly for private projects:

```bash
npm install -g snyk
snyk test               # Scan all dependencies
snyk monitor           # Continuous monitoring
```

## Automated link and route validation

**broken-link-checker** crawls your entire application to find 404s, broken external links, and redirect chains without any configuration:

```bash
npm install --save-dev broken-link-checker
npx blc http://localhost:3000 -ro --filter-level 1
```

For compile-time safety, **next-type-safe-routes** prevents broken links during development by type-checking all Next.js routes at build time.

## Complete CI/CD integration blueprint

Here's a production-ready GitHub Actions workflow combining the essential tools:

```yaml

## Implementation strategy for maximum impact

Start with these five tools for immediate comprehensive coverage: **Nuclei** for security scanning, **Trivy** for container security, **Pa11y** for accessibility, **Schemathesis** for API testing, and **Ruff** for Python code quality. These provide the highest value-to-effort ratio and can be implemented in under an hour.

Scale up by adding **Lighthouse CI** for performance regression tracking, **Snyk** for enhanced dependency scanning, and **CodeQL** for semantic security analysis. The entire suite runs in parallel during CI/CD, typically completing all scans in under 5 minutes for medium-sized projects.

Every tool listed is actively maintained with strong community adoption, ensuring long-term viability for your testing infrastructure. The combination provides comprehensive automated testing coverage without writing a single test case, letting you focus on building features while maintaining enterprise-grade quality assurance.
