   - Minimum TLS Version: **1.2**

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation Procedures

### Step 1: Pre-Production Testing

1. **Test WAF Rule Syntax**
   ```bash
   # Use Cloudflare API to validate rules
   curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/firewall/rules/preview" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"targets":[{"target":"ip","constraint":{"operator":"ip_in_list","value":"monitoring_services_ips"}}]}'
   ```

2. **Validate IP Lists**
   ```bash
   # Test IP list creation
   curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}"
   ```

### Step 2: Production Validation Testing

#### Test 4: Rate Limiting Validation

1. **Rapid Request Test**
   ```bash
   # Test rate limiting (should trigger after threshold)
   for i in {1..70}; do
     curl -H "User-Agent: test-monitoring-tool" https://aclue.app &
   done
   wait
   ```

### Step 3: Monitoring and Alerting Verification

1. **Check Cloudflare Analytics**
   - Go to **Analytics & Logs** â†’ **Security**
   - Verify rule hit rates and blocked requests
   - Confirm legitimate tools are not being blocked

2. **Configure Monitoring Alerts**
   ```bash
   # Set up alert for excessive WAF blocks of monitoring tools
   # (Configure in your monitoring system)
   ```

## Phase 4: Documentation and Training

### Step 1: Update Documentation

1. **Create Configuration Record**
   - Document all created rules and their purposes
   - Record IP list contents and sources
   - Note rate limiting thresholds and rationales

2. **Update Runbooks**
   - Include WAF allowlist in incident response procedures
   - Document troubleshooting steps for monitoring failures
   - Add emergency bypass procedures

### Step 2: Team Training

1. **Operations Team Training**
   - How to access and modify WAF rules
   - Emergency response procedures
   - Monitoring dashboard navigation

2. **Development Team Guidelines**
   - How to request new tool allowlisting
   - Testing procedures for CI/CD integration
   - Local development bypass methods

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Bypass Activation

1. **Critical Testing Bypass**
   ```
   Rule Name: emergency_bypass
   Expression: (ip.src eq "YOUR_EMERGENCY_IP")
   Action: Allow
   TTL: 4 hours maximum
   ```

2. **Bulk Testing Window**
   - Temporarily disable rate limiting rules
   - Enable comprehensive logging
   - Set automatic re-enablement after 4 hours

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)

1. **Disable All Custom Rules**
   - Go to **Security** â†’ **WAF** â†’ **Custom rules**
   - Toggle off all monitoring allowlist rules
   - Revert to default security settings

2. **Emergency Communication**
   ```bash
   # Notify team immediately
   echo "WAF allowlist rollback initiated due to critical issues" | \
   mail -s "URGENT: WAF Configuration Rollback" team@aclue.app
   ```

#### Gradual Rollback (Fine-tuning)

1. **Disable Individual Rules**
   - Start with lowest priority rules
   - Monitor impact for 15-minute intervals
   - Document performance and security metrics

2. **Re-enable with Adjustments**
   - Modify rule parameters based on observed data
   - Test individual rule effectiveness
   - Update documentation with changes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Monitoring Tool Blocked (403 Error)

**Symptoms**: Legitimate monitoring tool receiving 403 Forbidden
**Diagnosis**: Check if IP is in allowlist, verify user-agent pattern
**Solution**: 
1. Verify IP address in correct list
2. Check user-agent string matches rule
3. Temporarily add IP to emergency bypass

#### Issue 2: High False Positive Rate

**Symptoms**: Legitimate traffic being blocked by WAF rules
**Diagnosis**: Review Cloudflare security events log
**Solution**:
1. Identify common patterns in blocked requests
2. Adjust rule expressions to be more specific
3. Add exception rules for identified patterns

#### Issue 3: Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Increased response times after rule implementation
**Diagnosis**: Check rule complexity and processing overhead
**Solution**:
1. Optimise rule expressions for efficiency
2. Reduce regex complexity where possible
3. Consider rule ordering and prioritisation

### Escalation Procedures

1. **Level 1**: Operations team troubleshooting (0-30 minutes)
2. **Level 2**: Security team consultation (30-60 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Emergency rollback activation (60+ minutes)
4. **Level 4**: Vendor escalation to Cloudflare support
