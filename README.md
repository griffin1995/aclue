# aclue 
A data-led insight layer that transforms how gifts are chosen, letting recipients share who they are, not what they want.

## 🎯 Project Overview

aclue is a data-led gifting platform that lets recipients privately share their preferences through swipe-based discovery. Instead of creating product wishlists, users build dynamic taste profiles that help others choose better gifts — while preserving the magic of surprise.

Backed by a growing need for intelligent gifting, aclue operates within the £400B+ global gifting market and forecasts £2.5M in Year 3 revenue through affiliate partnerships and data-driven monetization.

aclue bridges the gap between thoughtful giving and modern digital behavior — solving the universal problem of gift-giving uncertainty through insight, not awkwardness.

### Business Context
- **🎯 Target Market**
	•	Operates within the £400B+ global gifting industry, covering personal, seasonal, and corporate occasions.
	•	Focuses on the fast-growing £100B+ digital gifting segment, where consumers increasingly seek convenience, personalisation, and surprise.
	•	UK market opportunity: ~£9.3B, with high ecommerce adoption and strong cultural gifting traditions.

⸻

- **💸 Revenue Model**
	1.	Affiliate Commissions
	•	Partners with retailers and marketplaces.
	•	Earns an average 7.5% commission per purchase made through aclue-generated gift links.
	2.	Premium Subscriptions (future roadmap)
	•	Optional upgrades for power users and businesses.
	•	Includes features like deeper taste analytics, priority suggestions, and branded profiles.
	3.	Future Revenue Streams (optional)
	•	Insight licensing for corporate gifting tools.
	•	API access for ecommerce platforms.

⸻

- **📈 User Growth Targets**
	•	1M+ cumulative users by Year 3, driven by shareable, receiver-created profiles.
	•	Viral loop: every gift shared brings a new user into the ecosystem.
	•	Targeting a 25–30% improvement in gift satisfaction, measured via feedback loops and retention metrics.

⸻

- **👥 Primary Customer Segments**
	1.	Digital Natives (18–35)
	•	Social, tech-savvy users who want to give meaningful gifts with minimal friction.
	•	Comfortable sharing personality data and expecting personalization in return.
	2.	Busy Professionals (25–45)
	•	Time-constrained but thoughtful — want smarter ways to shop for friends, partners, and colleagues.
	3.	Corporate Gifting & HR Teams
	•	Use cases in employee recognition, client gifting, and workplace culture tools.
	•	aclue can streamline discovery while preserving recipient delight.

⸻

- **🧠 Why Now?**
	•	Wishlists are outdated: Static, awkward, and often ignored.
	•	AI-only solutions fall short: Cold, inaccurate, and impersonal without input from the receiver.
	•	aclue offers a third way:
Receiver-led. AI-enhanced. Surprise preserved.

### Common Development Issues & Solutions

#### Backend Server Issues
- **"Failed to connect"**: Ensure backend running on port 8000 (`curl http://localhost:8000/health`)
- **"Permission denied"**: Check Supabase RLS policies and service key configuration
- **"Import errors"**: Verify virtual environment activated (`source venv/bin/activate`)
- **"Database errors"**: Confirm Supabase credentials in .env file

#### Frontend Issues  
- **"Network error"**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` in .env.local
- **"Auth errors"**: Check JWT token format and expiration in browser developer tools
- **"Build errors"**: Clear Next.js cache (`rm -rf .next`) and reinstall dependencies
- **"CORS errors"**: Confirm backend CORS settings allow frontend origin

#### Database Issues
- **"Query failed"**: Verify Supabase credentials and table permissions
- **"Data not found"**: Check RLS policies allow service key access for backend operations
- **"Schema errors"**: Ensure database schema matches application Pydantic models
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check Supabase service status and network connectivity

### Success Indicators ✅
**System Working Correctly:**
- Backend health check returns `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0"}`
- Frontend loads successfully at http://localhost:3000
- User registration and login work end-to-end without errors
- API documentation accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Database queries return expected data within reasonable time
- All API endpoints respond with proper HTTP status codes

### Development Environment Verification
```bash
# Quick system check
curl http://localhost:8000/health                    # Backend health
curl -I http://localhost:3000                        # Frontend availability
curl http://localhost:8000/docs                      # API documentation

# Test complete auth flow
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name":"Test","last_name":"User","email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123"}'
```
