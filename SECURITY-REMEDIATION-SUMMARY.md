   - Rate limiting protection
   - DDoS mitigation

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Set up security hooks
./setup-security.sh

# 2. Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 3. Set up monitoring
cd monitoring
./setup-monitoring.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# 4. Access monitoring dashboards
# Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/aclue_monitoring_2025)
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093
```

### Cloudflare WAF Configuration
1. Access Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Security ‚Üí WAF ‚Üí Custom Rules
3. Import rules from `cloudflare-waf-testing-allowlist.json`
4. Replace placeholder IPs with actual testing infrastructure IPs
5. Enable rules during testing periods only

## üìà Monitoring Dashboards

### Available Dashboards
1. **Platform Overview**: Real-time system health
2. **API Performance**: Response times and throughput
3. **Error Tracking**: Error rates and types
4. **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk metrics
5. **Security Events**: Authentication attempts and failures

### Key Metrics Tracked
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Request rate and error rate
- Database connection pool usage
- Newsletter send success rate
- Authentication success/failure ratio
- System resource utilisation
- Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS)

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** - Pre-commit hooks will block them
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Run security checks** before pushing: `pre-commit run --all-files`
4. **Monitor alerts** in Grafana for performance issues
5. **Review security scan results** in GitHub Actions

### For DevOps
1. **Rotate secrets quarterly** using secure methods
2. **Review monitoring alerts daily** for anomalies
3. **Update dependencies monthly** for security patches
4. **Perform security audits quarterly** using the test suite
5. **Maintain WAF rules** and update allowlists as needed

## üìù Maintenance Schedule

### Daily Tasks
- Review Grafana alerts
- Check error rates
- Monitor API performance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review security scan results
- Update dependencies
- Check certificate expiry

### Monthly Tasks
- Rotate API keys
- Review WAF logs
- Update monitoring thresholds
- Perform load testing

### Quarterly Tasks

- Disaster recovery drill
- Documentation update

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Within 48 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Configure RESEND_API_KEY in alertmanager configuration
2. ‚úÖ Update monitoring endpoint URLs with production values
3. ‚úÖ Test pre-commit hooks with development team
4. ‚úÖ Deploy monitoring stack to production environment

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1. Integrate monitoring with existing alerting systems
2. Train team on security tools and processes
3. Document incident response procedures
4. Set up automated security reports

### Long-term Goals (1-3 months)
