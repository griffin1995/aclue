## ðŸŽ¯ PRACTICAL CONSENSUS DECISIONS

### 1. **Server/Client Component Split Strategy**

**Context-Aware Split Ratios** (75% agent agreement):
```typescript
const COMPONENT_SPLIT_RATIOS = {
  // Authentication & User Data (High Security)
  authentication: { server: 85, client: 15 },
  userProfiles: { server: 85, client: 15 },

  // Core Platform Features (Balanced)
  productCatalog: { server: 75, client: 25 },
  recommendations: { server: 75, client: 25 },

  // Interactive Features (UX Optimized)
  userInteractions: { server: 65, client: 35 },
  shoppingCart: { server: 70, client: 30 },

  // Presentation Layer (Client Heavy)
  marketing: { server: 45, client: 55 },
  staticContent: { server: 40, client: 60 }
};
```

**Overall Average**: 75/25 server/client split

### 2. **Security Implementation Tiers**

**Graduated Security Complexity** (75% agent agreement):

**Tier 1 - Critical Security** (Maximum Defense-in-Depth):
- Authentication flows, payment processing, user data management
- Enhanced middleware with comprehensive monitoring
- 90%+ server-side processing

**Tier 2 - Core Features** (Balanced Security + DX):
- Product catalog, recommendations, user preferences
- DX-optimized tooling with intelligent security abstractions
- 75% server-side processing

**Tier 3 - Presentation Layer** (Deployment Optimized):
- UI components, static content, marketing pages
- Simplified security model for low-risk components
- 50% server-side processing

### 3. **Development Experience Safeguards**

**DX Productivity Requirements** (75% agent agreement):
- **Build time increase**: <15% during security hardening
- **Hot reload preservation**: Maintain sub-second feedback loops
- **Developer onboarding**: <10 minutes with security infrastructure
- **Rollback capabilities**: Instant revert for stability issues
